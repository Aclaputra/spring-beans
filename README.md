### Inversion of Control 
Inversion of Control is a principle in software engineering which transfers the control of objects or portions of a program to a container or framework. We most often use it in the context of object-oriented programming.

[spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html). [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control)

### Test Driven Development
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases. This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
